I am a software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a focus on machine learning, currently pursuing my Master’s degree at Georgia Tech. My experience includes leading a team at STEM-Away in developing an NLP classifier with Google’s BERT model and presenting webinars on data mining and web scraping techniques. At UC Irvine, I collaborated on research projects, using machine learning to analyze bibliometric data from NASA ADS.

My coursework at Georgia Tech and UC Irvine has provided me with deep insights into advanced algorithms, neural networks, and practical applications of machine learning. In my personal projects, I have utilized PyTorch and TensorFlow to build and experiment with various deep learning models, applying these tools to solve complex problems and refine my technical expertise. I am also actively self-learning about large language models (LLMs) and their applications, including Langchain. I am proficient in Python, Java, C/C++, and web technologies, and experienced with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. I am currently seeking software engineering roles with a focus on machine learning and AI, where I can apply my skills to create impactful solutions.
